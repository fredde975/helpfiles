Do diffs
=========
git diff 			 : compares working dir with staging area
git diff --staged     		 : compares staging area with repository
git diff commit1 commiit2	 : compares commits

git show "commit-id" 		: shows diff camared to its parent

git log				:

git log -n 1			: show only log for one commit

git add				: add files to staging area

git reset --hard		: reset working dir


git checkout master		: checkout branch master

git branch			: status

git branch easy_mode		: create branch

git checkout easy_mode		: checkout branch

git checkout -b branch-name	: create and checkout new branch

git log --graph --oneline master branch-name

git branch -d "branch-name"

set up environment
==================

merge
=====
git merge master branch		: the bracnh will be merged into master


resolve merge conflict
======================
0. run git status
1. open file with conflict
2. edit the areas that are in conflict with each other
3. git add file-name
4. git commit


set up password caching towards github
======================================
git config --global credential.helper cache
# Set git to use the credential memory cache

git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'
# Set the cache to timeout after 1 hour (setting is in seconds)

use ssh towards github
======================
https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/

synching repositories with github
=================================
1. create an empty remote repository at github
2. push (a branch) master to github


To see remote repositories
==========================
git remote -v 				: -v for verbose 

add a remote repository
=======================
git remote add  origin	url

push changes to remote repository
=================================
git push origin master

pull changes from remote repository
===================================
git pull origin master

clone repository from github
============================
git clone https://github.com/fredde975/recipes.git

updating the local copy of the remote branch: note there is a difference
between origin/master and the local master branch
============================================
git fetch


git pull origin master => git fetch origin followed by git merge master origin/master

find out difference between the two local branches:  origin/master (the
current local repr. of the origin/master located at GitHub) and master 
=======================================================================
git log origin/master or git diff origin/master master



if there are both updates from the "git fetch" command and there
are updates in my local master branch then "git status" will report that
master is "out-of-synch"
