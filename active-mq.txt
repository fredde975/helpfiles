to start activemq with demo examples
====================================
bin/activemq console xbean:examples/conf/activemq-demo.xml


Prerequisites
 
Before running the examples you should try running a JMS broker on your
machine. Follow the Installation instructions to use a binary distribution of
ActiveMQ. To run the broker in a command shell, type:
 
bin/activemq console
 
This starts up ActiveMQ.
Running
From the command line you can run
${ACTIVEMQ_HOME}/bin/activemq producer
${ACTIVEMQ_HOME}/bin/activemq consumer
 
If you have activemq-all jar available you can achieve the same with
java -jar activemq-all-5.x.x.jar producer
java -jar activemq-all-5.x.x.jar consumer
If you run inside Karaf, you can run the commands as
activemq:producer
activemq:consumer
 
Options
For all options on the commands, run them with --help parameter. The up to
date, options for producer and consumer can be found in the source.
Examples
Here are a couple of examples of more advanced features.
To send a text message with custom text use
bin/activemq producer --message "My message" --messageCount 1
To send byte message of custom length use
bin/activemq producer --messageSize 100 --messageCount 1
To send a text message with content obtained from an url
bin/activemq producer --payloadUrlÂ
http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core/activemq-core.xsdÂ --messageCount 1
To consume in transaction use
bin/activemq consumer --transacted true
To use client acknowledgment use
bin/activemq consumer --ackMode CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE
To use durable topic subscribers use
bin/activemq consumer --durable true --clientId example --destination
topic://TEST
Old examples
In older versions of ActiveMQ, the corresponding examples were located in
examples/ or examples/openwire/swissarmy/ directories, where you can do the
similar tasks with an ant script.
ant producer
ant consumer
Other examples
In examples/ directory (depending on the version) you can find more examples
of using the broker with variety of protocols (mqtt, amqp, ...) and clients
(Java, Ruby, JavaScript, ...), so it's the good place to start learning. Also,
examples/conf/ directory contains a lot of different configuration examples
that you can use as a starting point for your deployment.
